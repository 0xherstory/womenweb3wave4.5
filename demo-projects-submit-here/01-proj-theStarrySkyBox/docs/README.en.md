## 🌟 Vision & Mission

**Project Name:** The Starry Sky Box (星空宝盒)

**One-Line Vision:** We are committed to transforming the precious correspondence between girls in remote areas and volunteers into a private, eternal, and truly owned "digital memorabilia box."

**Core Mission:** In this era of instant messaging overflow, a handwritten letter carries unique warmth and sincerity. For girls participating in the "Rainbow Charity Society" project, these letters are precious spiritual wealth on their growth journey. However, paper yellows and files get lost. Our mission is to use Web3 technology to **grant eternity** to this warmth, **grant ownership** to this sincerity, and **grant power** to this creation - all without adding any burden to the girls or changing the core experience of "handwritten letters."

## 💡 Our Belief: Technology Should Serve People, Not Disturb

We deeply recognize that the soul of this project is the humanistic care represented by "handwritten letters." Therefore, our core principles are:

- **Technology Behind the Scenes:** The girls' experience must be extremely simple and beautiful. They don't need to understand any complex concepts about blockchain, NFTs, or wallets.
- **Empowerment, Not Replacement:** Our goal is not to "optimize" processes with technology, but to "enhance" dimensions that traditional technology cannot solve, such as permanence, ownership, and value circulation.

## 🛠️ Solution: Web3 Empowerment Under "Guardian" Model

To achieve the above goals, we designed an innovative model with "Rainbow Charity Society" as the **Digital Box Guardian**, consisting of three core components:

### 1. Core Function: "Starry Sky Box" Gallery

- **User Experience:** Each girl gets a password-protected personal homepage that belongs only to her. When she logs in, she doesn't see a cold list, but a tranquil, beautiful **private starry sky**.

- **Visualization of Growth:** Each "digital token" (whether received letters or her own artwork) becomes a shining star, illuminating her night sky. Over time, her starry sky becomes more brilliant, which itself is a powerful and intuitive emotional motivation.

- **Zero-Barrier Access:** This webpage requires no browser wallet plugins; girls can access it on any ordinary computer or mobile browser, with an experience identical to logging into regular websites.

### 2. Core Asset: "Digital Token" NFTs

- **Minting Memories:** Each vetted communication content (letters, photos, artwork) will be "minted" by the charity into a unique, unforgeable "digital ownership certificate" (NFT).

- **Permanent Preservation:** The ownership records of these NFTs are permanently and immutably recorded on the public blockchain (testnet). The corresponding content files (images, etc.) are stored through **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Arweave (Permanent Web)** dual solutions, ensuring they are never lost.

- **True Ownership:** This NFT will be directly sent to the exclusive "digital box" (a Web3 wallet address) created for the girl. From both code and legal perspectives, this memory belongs only to her.

### 3. Core Guarantee: "Graduation Day" Handover Ceremony

- **Trusted Guardianship:** Before the girl reaches adulthood, her "digital box" is kept under the highest level of security by "Rainbow Charity Society" as guardian.

- **Return of Power:** At her high school graduation, or whenever she's ready, the charity will initiate a solemn **Key Handover Ceremony**, completely and thoroughly returning the full control (private key) of this "digital box" to her. This is the ultimate embodiment of Web3 spirit - we're not building a platform that belongs to us, but guarding wealth that will ultimately be controlled by them.

## 🚀 Future Chapters: From "Memorabilia" to "Creator Economy"

This project has enormous growth potential. We envision the next development direction aimed at granting girls true economic autonomy.

### "Dual Safe" and Selective Disclosure

**Respecting Wishes**  
We will design **"public" and "private"** storage modes for each NFT.

- **Public Content:** If a girl agrees to publicly display her artwork, its images can be publicly accessed.
- **Private Content:** Private letters will be encrypted with her personal public key before uploading to the decentralized network. Only she can decrypt and view them.

**Opening Economic Doors**
- **Economic Empowerment:** For artwork she chooses to make public, we can make their NFTs compatible with mainstream markets (like OpenSea), making them sellable digital artworks.
- **Eternal Royalties:** Using the EIP-2981 royalty standard, we can write rules into NFTs: "Every time this artwork is successfully resold in the future, 10% of the sale price will automatically and permanently flow directly into the girl's wallet address." This provides her with a sustainable income source free from middleman exploitation.

## 📈 Current Status & Next Steps

### Completed Features ✅

- ✅ Completed core smart contract development and testnet deployment
- ✅ Established complete pipeline for content on-chain using Pinata and IPFS
- ✅ Developed a fully functional "private starry sky gallery" frontend accessible without wallets

### Next Action Plan 🎯

1. **Internal Testing & Feedback:** Share existing Demo with core project members and some volunteers for feedback
2. **Improve "Guardian" Backend:** Design a simple, secure backend interface for charity staff to manage girls' "digital boxes" and batch mint NFTs
3. **Explore "Dual Safe":** Research and implement encrypted storage and selective display functionality
4. **Plan Handover Ceremony:** Collaborate with the charity to plan secure processes and user education for the "key handover ceremony"
