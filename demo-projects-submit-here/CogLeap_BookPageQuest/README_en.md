# **Cognitive Leap: Book Page Quest** Project Introduction

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Cognitive Leap: Book Page Quest (CogLeap: Book Page Quest)
- **Project Description**: A Web3-based knowledge game platform designed to transform complex book knowledge into engaging level challenges through gamification. Players learn and earn project tokens (MIND) rewards by reading condensed knowledge scenarios, making choices, and receiving instant feedback during the quest.
- **Project Background**: This project aims to explore the intersection of Web3, gamification, and knowledge, addressing the dryness of traditional practical book reading. By designing core concepts from classic books like "Cognitive Awakening" and "Game Theory" into interactive, real-life scenarios, knowledge acquisition becomes not only fun but also brings practical digital asset returns and NFT achievement commemorations.

## 2. Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain Type**: Designed to run on EVM-compatible public chains
- **Technical Framework**:
    - **Frontend**: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS
    - **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
    - **Smart Contracts**: Solidity + Hardhat
- **Network Structure**: Adopts the standard Decentralized Application (DApp) structure. The frontend application interacts directly with smart contracts deployed on the blockchain via libraries like Ethers.js to complete core logic such as token reward distribution and NFT achievement recording.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Relies on the consensus mechanism of the target public chain

## 3. Core Features

- **Feature One: Book Level Challenges**: Players select books of interest (e.g., "Cognitive Awakening") and enter the chapter list. By completing scenario-based question and answer levels within each chapter, they earn MIND token rewards and unlock subsequent chapters. This mode breaks down the reading process into achievable small goals, enhancing learning motivation.
- **Feature Two: Random Challenges**: AI randomly generates different scenario questions. Players apply their learned knowledge to the challenges; successful attempts reward tokens, while failures incur token deductions.
- **Feature Three: Community Practice**: Players discuss difficult scenarios encountered in real life and apply learned knowledge to solve problems.

## 4. Application Scenarios

- **Scenario One: Mind Training**: The core gameplay of the platform is based on real-life scenario Q&A, which forces users to apply learned knowledge to decision-making, thereby deepening understanding and memory, truly achieving "learning by doing."
- **Scenario Two: Cognitive Enhancement**: For users who wish to learn knowledge in fields like cognitive thinking but are intimidated by thick books, the platform provides an easy and fun entry point.
- **Scenario Three: Solving Real-life Difficulties**: Guides personal growth and solves real-life problems.

## 5. Project Team

- **Team Introduction**: Individual development

## 6. Development Plan

- **Roadmap**:
    1. Module Expansion: Continue developing modules such as "Random Challenges," "Community Interaction," and "Leaderboards" to increase game playability and social interaction.
    2. Content Expansion: Introduce more high-quality books from various fields and collaborate with original authors or communities to create more levels.
- **Future Outlook**: Committed to building "Cognitive Leap" into an open, decentralized "knowledge gamification" platform. In the future, content creators will be allowed to design and publish book levels independently, integrate AI assistants, forming a community-driven, co-creating Web3 learning ecosystem.
